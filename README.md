D3 Healthcare and Poverty

In this project, I pull in data from the US Census Bureau about poverty, age, income, healthcare, obesity, and smokes. With this data, I create an interactive visualization in the form of a scatter plot that shows the relationship between all of these data pieces. Data is given from all 50 states in addition to Washington D.C.

Using D3 packages within JavaScript, I am able to construct a plot to show the relationships. With the aid of HTML, we can publish this data onto a live server on the web.
